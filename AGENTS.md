Beavers vs towers vs maths

A maths-themed game similar in concept to Angry Birds, suitable for a 7yo

However, there are key differences:
- The catapult shows an arrow to make it easy to aim for a child.  The arrow is longer when velocity (release speed) is higher and shorter when its slower.
- Left/right arrows change angle, up down changes launch speed


TO begin with, I want:
- a ball catapult/launcher.
- a camera that zooms in and out smoothly
- 'Domino' shapes are placed on n fixed platforms, arranged in a parabola that follows a possible path of a ball fired from the catapult.  i.e. if user gets angle and velocity right, they could knock down all the dominoes.

The game is implemented as a vite project.  Phaser game engine.  Rapier physics with @phaserjs/rapier-connector'
